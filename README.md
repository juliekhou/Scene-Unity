# Homework-1-Craft-a-Scene
### Did anything inspire you? What is your scene? What kinds of objects did you include? What is the main character in this scene?

My scene is inspired by my real bedroom, or ‘Julie’s Abode.’ It’s not an exact replica (I wish I had an arcade cabinet in there)
but this scene of my room is about 80% accurate. I included objects that resembled ones in my room. I have my bed and desk in the
corners of my room across from one another, such as in the scene. I also have a dresser and a laundry basket in the right corner
of the room, as well as an abundance of plants everywhere and a stool in front of my bed. The main character in my scene is
a pink origami rat because my nickname on Discord has been “a rat” since… forever… and I thought it was so cute!
